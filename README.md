# Example Movie Project
# Written by Brandi Williams

# Functionality
# - User can search the Open Movies database
# - User can get more info on any of the returned results
# - User can add any of the results to their favorites
# - Previously added favorites are listed on page load
# - A link to the raw JSON favorites file is provided
# - If a user has already favorited a movie and it turns up in the search results, display an image of a heart instead of an
#   add to favorites button
# - Give the user feedback that their favorites list was updated when they click to add a favorites

# Notes
# - The node portion provided was to be debugged/fixed
# - The rest of the prompt was to be completed via vanilla javascript (plus HTML/CSS)
# - A working version was to be hosted on Heroku or DigitalOcean

# Limitations
# - Items cannot be removed from the favorites list
# - This app works for a single user (to support different users having different favorites we need to do a lot more work)
# - It would be nice if the results table were sortable
# - It would be nice of the favorites list was clickable for more info
# - It would be nice to go back and complete the bonus as well

# Deployment
# - Heroku: https://damp-taiga-54536.herokuapp.com/
# - GitHub: https://github.com/brandiw/moviesdata
